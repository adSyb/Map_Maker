# Map_Maker

This is a quick and dirty combination of [Martin O'Leary's code](http://mewo2.com/notes/terrain/) for generating random fantasy maps and the [MDN instructions](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Drawing_DOM_objects_into_a_canvas) for drawing SVG on Canvas in order to get a PNG file. Thrown together for a friend.
